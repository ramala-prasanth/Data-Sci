In the example about pea flowers, it is just as clear that the observed statistic is consistent with the distribution that the null predicts. So in both of the examples, it is clear which hypothesis to choose.\n","\n","But sometimes the decision is not so clear. Whether the observed test statistic is consistent with its predicted distribution under the null hypothesis is a matter of judgment. \n","\n","It is recommended that you provide your judgment along with the value of the test statistic and a graph of its predicted distribution under the null. That will allow one to make a judgment about whether the two are consistent. \"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q_gl71tfu3pt"},"source":["A Berkeley Statistics class of about 350 students was divided into 12 discussion sections led by Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs).

Surely, they feel, there must have been something wrong with the GSI's teaching. Or else why would their section have done worse than others?\n","\n","The GSI, typically more experienced about statistical variation, often has a different perspective: if you simply draw a section of students at random from the whole class, their average score could resemble the score that the students are unhappy about, just by chance.\n","The GSI's position is a clearly stated chance model.
